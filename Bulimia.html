      <h2> Bulimia nervosa</h2>
       <img src="https://cdn0.iconfinder.com/data/icons/psychology-disorder-aqua-vol-1/500/Bulimia_Nervosa-512.png">
      <h5>Bulimia nervosa is a serious, potentially life-threatening eating disorder characterized by a cycle of bingeing and compensatory behaviors such as self-induced vomiting designed to undo or compensate for the effects of binge eating.</h5>

      <p>Common signs of binge eating disorder include:

Evidence of binge eating, including disappearance of large amounts of food in a short time, or finding lots of empty food wrappers or containers,
Hoarding food, or hiding large quantities of food in strange places,
Wearing baggy clothes to hide the body,
Skipping meals or avoiding eating in front of others,
Constantly dieting, but rarely losing weight.</p>
      <br>
      <h2></h2>
      <h5></h5>
      <p>Admit you have a problem. Up until now, you’ve been invested in the idea that life will be better—that you’ll finally feel good—if you lose more weight and control what you eat. The first step in bulimia recovery is admitting that your relationship to food is distorted and out of control.

Talk to someone. It can be hard to talk about what you’re going through, especially if you’ve kept your bulimia a secret for a long time. You may be ashamed, ambivalent, or afraid of what others will think. But it’s important to understand that you’re not alone. Find a good listener—someone who will support you as you try to get better.

Stay away from people, places, and activities that trigger the temptation to binge or purge. You may need to avoid looking at fashion or fitness magazines, spend less time with friends who constantly diet and talk about losing weight, and stay away from weight loss web sites and “pro-mia” sites that promote bulimia. You may also need to be careful when it comes to meal planning and cooking magazines and shows.

Address any underlying mood disorder. It’s common for people with bulimia to also suffer from depression or anxiety. Getting help for co-existing conditions is vital to your bulimia recovery.

Seek professional help. The advice and support of trained eating disorder professionals can help you regain your health, learn to eat normally again, and develop healthier attitudes about food and your body.
